import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import { ExecutionCount } from '@/registry/cell/ExecutionCount';

<div className="my-8 flex flex-wrap gap-4">
  <ExecutionCount count={null} />
  <ExecutionCount count={null} isExecuting={true} />
  <ExecutionCount count={1} />
</div>

A cell primitive that displays the execution count indicator for notebook cells. Shows `[ ]:` for never executed cells, `[*]:` for currently executing cells, and `[n]:` for executed cells with their count.

## Installation

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'Manual']}>
  <Tab value="CLI">
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest add https://nteract-elements.vercel.app/r/execution-count.json
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Manual">
    Copy the component from [nteract/elements](https://github.com/nteract/elements/blob/main/registry/cell/ExecutionCount.tsx).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```tsx
import { ExecutionCount } from "@/registry/cell/ExecutionCount"

export function CodeCell() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <ExecutionCount count={1} />
      <span>print("Hello, World!")</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## States

### Never Executed

Shows `[ ]:` when count is `null` and not executing.

<div className="my-4 flex gap-4">
  <ExecutionCount count={null} />
</div>

```tsx
<ExecutionCount count={null} />
```

### Currently Executing

Shows `[*]:` when `isExecuting` is `true`.

<div className="my-4 flex gap-4">
  <ExecutionCount count={null} isExecuting={true} />
</div>

```tsx
<ExecutionCount count={null} isExecuting={true} />
```

### Executed with Count

Shows `[n]:` when count is provided.

<div className="my-4 flex gap-4">
  <ExecutionCount count={1} />
  <ExecutionCount count={42} />
  <ExecutionCount count={999} />
</div>

```tsx
<ExecutionCount count={1} />
<ExecutionCount count={42} />
<ExecutionCount count={999} />
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `count` | `number \| null` | — | The execution count number, or `null` for never executed |
| `isExecuting` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the cell is currently executing |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes to apply |

## Styling

The component uses:
- Monospace font (`font-mono`) for consistent alignment
- Muted text color (`text-muted-foreground`) to match Jupyter conventions
- Small text size (`text-sm`)

You can customize the styling by passing a `className` prop:

```tsx
<ExecutionCount 
  count={1} 
  className="text-blue-600 font-bold" 
/>
```
